# Neuroscience Final Project: Deep Q Networks for Maze Solving

This repository contains the code and implementation for a neuroscience project focusing on **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**, an extension of Reinforcement Learning (RL). The objective of this project was to develop an agent capable of navigating and solving a maze, maximizing the rewards obtained through online learning.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implemented a Deep Q Network to train an agent in a maze-solving task. The agent starts with no knowledge of the environment and learns through exploration by storing states and rewards in its memory. Over time, the agent refines its strategy to maximize the total reward from start to finish.

Key components of the project include:
- **Deep Q Networks**: Integration of deep neural networks to enhance the agent's decision-making process.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques to allow the agent to learn through interaction with the environment.
- **Maze Solver**: Implementing the agent in a practical maze-solving scenario to test its learning performance.

## Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gym keras tensorflow
```

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to observe the agent's training process and performance in solving the maze.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuroscience-dqn-project.git
cd neuroscience-dqn-project
jupyter notebook Neuroscience_Project.ipynb
```
